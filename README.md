# homework1 Code Refactor

This is a homework assignment. In this homework assignment, I had to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible by using semantic html tags.

I replaced the non-semantic div tags with semantic tags like header main aside and footer. I also added alt attributes to all images to make the site more accessible.
